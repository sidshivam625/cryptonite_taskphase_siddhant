## changing file ownership

``chown`` can be used to change the ownership of any file but this command can only be used by the root user.
For this challenge, I was given the power to ``chown``. I changed the ownership of ``/flag`` to hacker and used ``cat /flag`` to access the flag.

## Groups and Files
``chgrp`` can be used to change the group ownership fo any file.

## Fun with Groups Names  

Used ``id`` command to check what group my user is in and then changed to group ownership to that group using chgrp.

## Changing permissions

Learnt how to read the permissions format of a file. Also learnt how to change the permissions of any file using the ``chmod`` command
SYNTAX: `chmod {mode} file`

## Executable files

Changed the execute permission of ``/challenge/run`` to access the flag

## permission tweaking practice

Used ``chmod`` to change the permissions of the ``/challenge/pwn`` file for completing each task given by the challenge.

it until you make it readable with chmod!

## permission setting practice

``chmod`` can also simply set permissions altogether, overwriting the old ones by using ``=``.

## the SUID Bit
The ``"Set User ID" (SUID)`` permissions bit allows the user to run a program as the owner of that program's file. 

![The SUID bit](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50eca17e-96be-4e0a-880b-669b5f35b878)

The s part in place of the executable bit means that the program is executable with SUID. It means that, regardless of what user runs the program (as long as they have executable permissions), the program will execute as the owner user (in this case, the root user).
