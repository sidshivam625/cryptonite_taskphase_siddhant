# comprehending commands
## cat: not the pet, but the command!
Learnt that cat is used for reading the contents of a file. It can also concatenate multiple files. 


Used ``` cat /flag``` command as directed to get the flag.
## catting absolute paths
````cat```` can be used to read files outside cwd by specyfying absolute path of file as cat's argument.

## more catting practice
The challenge restricted the use of ````cd```` command and forced to use the absolute path as arguement of ````cat````.

executed the ````cat```` command with the absolute path given and got the flag
## grepping for a needle in a haystack 
````grep```` command is used to search for contents in a file
used ``grep`` command to search for ``pwn.college`` in the `/flag` file and found the flag.

## listing files
Learnt the use of ``ls ``which lists the contents of the cwd.
The challenge hid the flag in random file in the ``challenge`` folder. Used ``ls`` to find the file. 



## touching files
``touch`` is used to create files. The challenge required us to create 2 files using ``touch``.


## removing files
``rm`` command is used to remove files. The challenge created a ``delete_me`` file which was required to be deleted using rm inorder to get the flag.

## hidden files
Learnt that some files can be hidden from ``ls`` by simply putting ``.`` infornt of the filename.
Hidden files can be listed by using ``ls -a``.
