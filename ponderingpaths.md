# Pondering paths
## The Root
Learnt that all filesystems start with ```/``` which is used to access a system's directories, files and programs.

Invoked ```/pwn``` to get the flag

## Program and  absolute paths
Learnt to access program using its absolute path .

Executed ```/challenge/pwn``` to get the flag.
## Position thy self 
Learnt that ```cd``` is used to change to another directory. 

Executed the ```/challenge/run```command to get the new directory. Switched to the new directory using ```cd```.
Executed ```/challenge/run``` again to get the flag

## Position elsewhere
Executed the ```/challenge/run```command to get the new directory. Switched to the new directory using ```cd```.
Executed ```/challenge/run``` again to get the flag.

## Position yet elsewhere
Executed the ```/challenge/run```command to get the new directory. Switched to the new directory using ```cd```.
Executed ```/challenge/run``` again to get the flag.

## implicit relative paths, from / 
Learnt that :
  A relative path is any path that does not start at root (i.e., it does not start with /).
  
  A relative path is interpreted relative to your current working directory (cwd).
  
  Your cwd is the directory that your prompt is currently located at.


Executed the ```/challenge/run```command to get the new directory. Switched to the new directory using ```cd```.
As given in the hint the relative path starts with c, so executed ```challenge/run``` to get the flag.
